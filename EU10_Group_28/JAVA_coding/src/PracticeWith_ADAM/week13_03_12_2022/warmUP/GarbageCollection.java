the automatic process of making space in a computer's
 memory by removing data that is no longer required or in use.

 how can we do objects un-referenced?
 1- make null

 String str="Cydeo";
        str=null;      cutting that connection

 2- assigning another value
  String str="Cydeo";
        str="Aydin";
